Made with Unity 2018.2.3f1 and [ML-Agents Beta 0.5.0a](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/releases/tag/0.5.0a). Check out the original [Medium post](https://medium.com/tensorflow/tf-jam-shooting-hoops-with-machine-learning-7a96e1236c32) by Abe Haskins that inspired this.

## Getting started
### Installing ML Agents and Tensorflow
1. First download [ML-Agents Beta 0.5.0a](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/releases/tag/0.5.0a) and import the ML-Agents folder (.../ml-agents-0.5.0a/UnitySDK/Assets/) into the projects asset folder.
2. Then install the [TFSharpPlugin unitypackage](https://s3.amazonaws.com/unity-ml-agents/0.5/TFSharpPlugin.unitypackage). 
3. Make sure you have all the necessary python dependencies installed. Find more information in the [installation docs](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Installation.md) of ML-Agents.

If you need more guidance check out the [basic guide](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Basic-Guide.md).

### Setting up the scene
After importing the packages we have to make sure everything is setup correctly. Make sure the agent is set to the following settings:

You can find those settings in the scene explorer under PlayerCollection/Player/BallSpawner(Agent).

## Using the pretrained model
I included a pretrained model in the Assets/ML-Model folder. I used my MacBook Pro to train this model for 7 hours and it pretty much hits the court everytime. To try it out, just drag the "editor_Academy_tfhoop-execute4-0" file to the "Graph Model" parameter in the brain.

## Train your own model
### Setting up the scene

1. Enable every "Player" gameobject and add it to "PlayerCollection". This way we can have multiple agents training at once. They are all connected to the same brain, so we can speed up the training process. Depending on your computer you can handle more or less agents at once. Just play around.

2. Set the Brain Type to External
